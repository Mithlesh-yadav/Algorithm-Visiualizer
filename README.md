Sorting Visualizer
This Sorting Visualizer is a web application that allows you to interactively visualize and compare various sorting algorithms. It's built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and includes implementations of the following sorting algorithms:

1.Bubble Sort
2.Insertion Sort
3.Merge Sort
4.Selection Sort
5.Quick Sort

Features
-Interactive sorting algorithm visualization.
-Multiple sorting algorithms to choose from.
-Adjustable sorting speed.
-Randomize array for sorting.

Algorithms
Bubble Sort
Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted.

Insertion Sort
Insertion Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time. 

It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.

Merge Sort
Merge Sort is an efficient, stable, and comparison-based sorting algorithm. It works on the divide-and-conquer principle, 
breaking down the unsorted list into smaller subproblems until the subproblems are simple enough to be solved directly.

Selection Sort
Selection Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly selecting the minimum element from the unsorted part of the array and
putting it in its correct position in the sorted part.

Quick Sort
Quick Sort is an efficient, in-place, and comparison-based sorting algorithm. It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and
partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot.
